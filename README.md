# Data Structures COSC2436

This series is from my Data Structures class from Austin Community College (ACC) in Austin, TX.  These files are heavily commented as they're for learning purposes.  The programs successively use advanced c++ methods in their code.  I.e.) arrays->vectors.

## Installation

Use terminal to compile the c++ files.
