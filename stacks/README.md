# Stacks

    This program creates a stack object that works with struct data type.
    The struct data type contains an int called ​id​ and a string called ​data​.

    This Stack is an array of pointers to the structs, not the structs themselves (array size 6).

## Installation

    Use terminal to compile the c++ files.
